There is an important disctinction between generative and discriminative models.
Given input data x and you want to classify the data into labels y. A generative model learns the joint probability distribution p(x,y) and a discriminative model learns the conditional probability distribution p(y|x) - which you should read as "the probability of y given x"([original answer][ref-4]).
### Why Naive? 
We assume that every feature is independent of the other ones.

### Why Bayes?
We apply Bayes' theorem in the classfier's decision rule.
### Why Classifiers?
NBC classify, meaning it predicts which set of categories a new observation belongs.

Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of probabilistic classifiers that is able to predict, given an observation of input, a probability distribution over a set of classes.
Support Vector Machine is popular supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both regression and classification. 
Its pros and cons can be summarized as follows
Pros:

+ Highly scalable, requiring a number of parameters linear in the number of predictors in a learning problem and hence faster compared to complicated algorithms.
+ Works well for high dimensional problems such as text classification because it makes a very strong assumption. 

Cons:

+ The naive assumptionis not usually the case in real life problems.
