It is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation. Different from supervised learning, it learns from its experience.

Q-Learning is a basic form of Reinforcement Learning which uses Q-values (also called action values) to iteratively improve the behavior of the learning agent.

The ‘q’ in q-learning stands for quality. Quality in this case represents how useful a given action is in gaining some future reward.
