From July to December 2020, I interned at a medical device startup on its medical ventilator project as an electrical engineer intern.

### Lesson 1: Work Is A Important Part of My Identity

I feel somewhat vulnerable in saying this, but I do discover that work makes up an important aspect of my identity. Working on a medical device gives me a certain sense of commitment. When the work is aligned with my personal values, that work itself becomes a form of self-expression.

After considerate soul searching, I realize that what matters to me is:

#### Wellness

Wellness is the foundation of everything for me. For me there are three main pillars of wellness: physical, mental and spiritual.

To take care of my physical wellness, I exercise for 45 minutes every day.

To take care of my mental wellness, I meditate for at least 10 minutes every day.

To take care of my spiritual wellness, I (am still trying) to pray every day.

Any work that contributes to wellness is something that I would be very interested in ;)

#### Learning/Growth

Learning, as I personally tend to believe, is why I am here on this earth. I would like to have a job that nourishes my inner need to learn and grow.



### Lesson 2: Speak Up For Myself

Because no one else will. I've learned this the hard way.

### Lesson 3: Company Culture Does Matter

I checked on the internet and found out that there are four main types of company cultures: clan culture, adhocracy culture, market culture, hierarchy culture. Personally I like clan culture the most, which is what experienced during my internship.

### Lesson 4: Keep A Work Log

One thing I regret is not documenting my work in a clear and coherent manner. By keeping a work log, I would have a clearer sense of what I struggled with or how I progressed in my career.
