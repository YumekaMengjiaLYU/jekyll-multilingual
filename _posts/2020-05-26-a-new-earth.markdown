「Behind every negative self­concept its the hidden desire of being the greatest or better than
others. Behind the confident ego's feeling of and continuing need for
superiority is the unconscious fear of inferiority. Conversely, the shy,
inadequate ego that feels inferior has a strong hidden desire for superiority.
Many people fluctuate between feelings of inferiority and superiority,
depending on situations or the people they come into contact with. All you
need to know and observe in yourself is this: whenever you feel superior or
inferior to anyone, that's the ego in you.」

「What is commonly called “falling in love” is in most cases and
intensification of egoic wanting and needing. You become addicted to
another person, or rather to your image of that person. It has nothing to do
with true love, which contains no wanting whatsoever. The Spanish language
is the most honest in regard to conventional notions of love: Te quiero means
“I want you” as well as “I love you.” The other expression for “I love you,” te
amo, which does not have this ambiguity, is rarely used – perhaps because
true love is just as rare. 」
