Trade-offs are _everywhere_. As an EE undergraduate taking courses in circuits, I was taught how circuit design is a game of trade-offs and there is never free lunch: we have to trade one thing for other desirable properties.    
For example, in analog design, we have to consider many aspects of the circuit performance such as linearity, noise, input/output impedance, stability, and voltage swings. There are usually trade-offs between these parameters and we cannot improve all of them simultaneously[3]. 
What is a bias-variance tradeoff?


$$ \nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x}) $$
