+ There is a building with 100 floors. You are given 2 identical eggs. How do you use 2 eggs to find the threshold floor, where the egg will definitely break from any floor above floor N, including floor N itself.
+ You randomly draw a coin from 100 coins — 1 unfair coin (head-head), 99 fair coins (head-tail) and roll it 10 times. If the result is 10 heads, what is the probability that the coin is unfair?
+ Write a sorting algorithm for a numerical dataset in Python.
+ Facebook would like to develop a way to estimate the month and day of people’s birthdays, regardless of whether people give us that information directly. What methods would you propose, and data would you use, to help with that task?
+ Use a python built-in package to manipulate ‘csv’ data.
+ How would you compare the relative performance of two different back-end engines for automated generation of Facebook “Friend” suggestions?
+ Given a KPI, choose the right metric, perform ETL. (using SQL/Code)
+ You’re about to get on a plane to Seattle. You want to know if you should bring an umbrella. You call 3 random friends of yours who live there and ask each independently if it’s raining. Each of your friends has a 2/3 chance of telling you the truth and a 1/3 chance of messing with you by lying. All 3 friends tell you that “Yes” it is raining. What is the probability that it’s actually raining in Seattle?
+ Consider a game with 2 players, A and B. Player A has 8 stones, player B has 6. Game proceeds as follows. First, A rolls a fair 6-sided die, and the number on the die determines how many stones A takes over from B. Next, B rolls the same die, and the exact same thing happens in reverse. This concludes the round. Whoever has more stones at the end of the round wins and the game is over. If players end up with equal # of stones at the end of the round, it is a tie and another round ensues. What is the probability that B wins in 1, 2, …, n rounds?
+ How do you get the count of each letter in a sentence?
+ How do you prove that males are on average taller than females by knowing just gender or height?
+ What is a monkey patch?
+ Given a list A of objects and another list B which is identical to A except that one element is removed, find the removed element.
+ Given a list of integers (positive & negative), write an algorithm to find whether there’s at least a pair of integers that sum up to zero. How would you improve your algorithm’s performance?
+ Make a histogram of 2 variables.
+ Build a histogram of post reply count in SQL (number of posts with x replies, x+1 replies, etc).
+ Build a table with a summary of feature usage per user every day (keep track of the last action by user and roll up every day).
+ You’re at a casino with two dice, if you roll a 5 you win, and get paid $10. What is your expected payout? If you play until you win (however long that takes) then stop, what is your expected payout?
+ What metric would you show small businesses if you were trying to have them sign up for Facebook Ads?
