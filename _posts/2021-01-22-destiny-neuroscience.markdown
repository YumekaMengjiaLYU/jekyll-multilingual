Looking back, I can see my strange entanglement with neuroscience.

very interesting encounter with a mouse when i was a kid

had a childhood friend whose mom had mental illness was warned that she might come at us when she got triggered

was curious about "the crazy" what are they 

anxiety and mental pushed me to understand myself better

First, I took my real psychology class in UCSD with Professor Angela. Though I later withdrew from the course due to time conflicts, I realized that psychology is not what I thought it talked about. I wanted something deeper and more intuitive.

I remembered that one day we sat together for a short ride on the school bus and he said he was working on neural engineering projects.

Then during my last at UCSD, I audit a course on the psychology of consciousness. It was a very interesting introduction to the foundation of neuroscience.

Then during I participated in a night school program at the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalytics. 
Audit a class at harvard neurobiology, and got to see and hold a human brain

in peru volunteer psychometrics down syndrome
Then during my time at home I found out about a research area called computational neuroscience.

Then now at Columbia I am doing research with neuroimaging statistcal analysis.
