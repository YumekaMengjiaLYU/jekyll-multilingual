In Chinese, there is a word 缘分[Yuanfen][ref-1]. I definitely feel it with neuroscience.

The biggest trigger that propels me to open the door to neuroscience, is my own long-term struggle with anxiety and a overly obsessive mind. I remember once that I caught a glimpse of the book _Because I Come from a Crazy Family: The Making of a Psychiatrist_ in a bookstore, and thought to myself, "wow I guess I can say because I am somewhat crazy myself". I felt drawn to the mental health profession, and figured that to make best use of my background it would be nice to study neuroscience. By a twist of fate, I came to Columbia to study biostatistics, with the hope of working on mental health data science. However, it wasn't until my last semester here that I was formally introduced to neuroimaging by Professor [Seonjoo Lee][ref-2]. I realize that this is what I could do to break into neuroscience and eventually get to understand how different forms of mental illnesses occur in people, myself included. 

My intellectual interest in neuroscience was first triggered when a friend of mine in college gave me a tour around his research lab. At the time, he was working as an undergraduate assistant for a neuroscience research team at Kavli Institute for Brain & Mind that investigated brain activity during mating in fruit flies using an innovative imaging technology called Flyception2. The realization that fruit flies also need brains in order to successfully mate struck me as intriguing, which left me with a desire in knowing what exactly happen in brains that produce our moment-to-moment experiences of thoughts and feelings, fears and desires. Later on, I happened to participate in the exhibition _The Beautiful Brain: The Drawings of Santiago Ramon y Cajal_ at MIT museum and was utterly amazed. 

Connecting the dots, it really feels like to me that Yuanfen is the best word that describes my relationship with neuroscience. What do you think about this? Have you noticed Yuanfen in your life? I'd love to see comments below :)
