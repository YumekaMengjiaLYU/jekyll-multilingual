I've never realized that Python is slow until I came across a talk on why C/C++ is used to implement certain functions in PyTorch.
As someone who was first introduced to programming with C and C++, I consider Python to be very user-friendly and ameniable. I thank [this][ref-1] article for giving me a bird-eye views of how programming languages compete in terms of fastness.

In my machine learning class, the professor emphasized on the importance of making use of vectorization in NumPy to make program run faster.
simple argument parsing logic can take microseconds
