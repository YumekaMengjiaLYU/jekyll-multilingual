$$Y = X\beta + \epsilon$$
$$\beta = (X'V^{-1}X)^{-1}X'V^{-1}Y$$

## Why
The GLM is a powerfultool, since many different types of analyses can be carried out
using it including: one-sample t-tests, two-sample t-tests, paired t-tests, ANOVA,
and ANCOVA. The first section illustrated simple linear regression in the example
where processing speed was modeled as a function of age. Figure A.2 shows some
common analyses that are carried out using the GLM where the top example is
the simplest model, a one-sample t-test.

Figure A.2. Examples of GLM models for popular study designs including: One-sample t-test, two-sample
t-test, paired t-test, and two-way ANOVA. The first column describes the model, the second
column describes how the data are ordered in the outcome vector, the third column shows
the design matrix, and the last column illustrates the hypothesis tests and corresponding
contrasts. Note, in the ANOVA example F-tests are used for all contrasts, whereas t-tests are
used for the other examples.
