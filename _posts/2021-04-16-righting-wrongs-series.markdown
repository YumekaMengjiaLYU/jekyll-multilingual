I want to introduce a series I plan to undertake in the upcoming months that intends to "right my wrongs".

Somewhere in my undergraduate career, I became increasingly incapable of focusing on what I would like to focus on and increasingly socially withdrawn and academically unmotivated.

I want to re-do what I wasn't capable of doing before, and I will publish more posts later in more specificity.
