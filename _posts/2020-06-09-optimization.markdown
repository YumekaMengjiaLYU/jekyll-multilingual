## 1.Intro and motivation

### Motivation

- Optimization algorithms are the basic engine behind deep learning methods that enable methods to learn from data by adapting their parameters.

- They solve the problem of the minimization of an objective function that measures the mistakes made by the model.
    - e.g. prediction error(classification), negative reward(reinforcement learning)

- Work by making a sequence of small incremental changes to model parameters that are each guaranteed to reduce the objective by some small amount.

### Basic notation

- Parameters
$$
\theta \in R^n
$$

- Real-valued objective function
$$
h(\theta)
$$

- Goal of optimization
$$
\theta^* = argmin h(\theta)
$$

### Example: neural metwork training objective
- The standard neural network training objective is given by:

$$
h(\theta)=\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \ell(y_i, f(x_i, \theta))
$$
## 2.Gradient descent
### Gradient descent: definition
- Basic gradient descent iteration:
$$
\theta_{k+1} = \theta_k - \alpha_k \nabla h(\theta_k)
$$

### Intuition: gradient descent is "steepest descent"

- Gradient direction $\nabla h(\theta_k)$ gives greatest reduction in $h(\theta_k)$ per unit of change in $\theta$.

- If $\nabla h(\theta_k)$ is "sufficiently smooth", and learning rate small, gradient will keep pointing down-hill over the region in which we take our step.

### Intuition: gradient descent is minimizing a local approximation

- 1st-order Taylor series for around current $\theta$ is

- For small enough d this will be a reasonable approximation

- Gradient update computed by minimizing this within a sphere of radius r

### The problem with gradient descent
High - diverge
Low - Converge very slowly

### Convergence theory: technical assumptions
- $h(\theta)$ has Lipchistz continuous derivatives


$$
\norm{\nabla h(\theta) - \nabla h(\theta')} \leq L\norm{\theta - \theta'}
$$
- is strongly convex (perhaps only near minimum) 
$$
h(\theta + d) \geq h(\theta) + \nabla h(\theta)^\top d + \frac{\mu}{2} \norm{d}^2
$$
- For now: gradients are computed exactly (i.e. without approximations/not stochastic)

### Convergence theory: upper bounds
If previous conditions hold and we take 

Number of iterations 

### Convergence theory: useful in practice?

- Issues with bounds such as this one:
    - too pessimistic (they must cover worst-case examples)
    - Some assumptions too strong (e.g. convexity)
    - Other assumptions too weak (real problems have additional useful structure)
    - Rely on crude measures of objective (e.g. condition numbers)
    - Usually focused on asymptotic behavior (do care how quickly you are getting to a point preaymptotically)

- The design/choice of an optimizer should always be informed by practice more than anything else. But theory can help guide the way and build intuitions.

## 3.Momentum methods

### The momentum method
- Motivation
    - the gradient has a tendency to flip back and forth as we take steps when the learning rate is large
    - e.g. the narrow valley
- The key idea:
    - accelerate movement along directions that point consistently down-hill across many consecutive iterations (i.e. have low curvature)
- How?
    - treat current solution for like a ball rolling along a surface whose height is given by, subject to the force of gravity

### Defining equations for momentum
Define
- Learning rate: $\alpha_k$
- Momentum constant: $\eta_k$

- Classical Momentum
$$
v_{k+1} = \eta_k v_k - \nabla h(\theta_k)
$$
- Nesterov's variant
$$
v_{k+1} = \eta_k v_k - \nabla h(\theta_k+\alpha_k \eta_k v_k)
$$

### Narrow 2D valley example revisited

### Upper bounds for Nesterov's momentum variant

Given objective $h(\theta)$ satisfying same technnical conditions, and careful choices of $\alpha_k$ and $\eta_k$,

Nesterov's momentum method satisfies:

$$
h(\theta_k) - h(\theta^*) \leq L(\frac{\sqrt{\kappa}-1}{\sqrt{\kappa}})^k \norm{\theta_0-\theta^*}^2
$$
### Convergence theory: 1st-order methods and lower bounds
- A first-order method is one where updates are linear combinations of observed gradients. 

- included:
    - gradient descent
    - momentum methods
    - conjugate gradients

- not included:
    - preconditioned gradient descent/2nd-order methods

### Lower bounds

No major algorithmic improvement

### Comparison of iteration counts
To achieve $h(\theta_k)-h(\theta*) \geq \epsilon$, the number of iterations k satisfies:
- (Worst case) lower bound for 1st-order methods
$$
\kappa \in \omega
$$
- Upper bound for gradient descent
- Upper bound for GD w/ Nesterov's momentum

## 4.2nd-order methods

### The problem with 1st-order methods
- **Dependency on global condition number**:For many 1st-order method, the number of steps needed to converge grows with "condition number":

$$
\kappa = \frac{Max curvature}{Min curvature}=\frac{L}{\mu}
$$

- **Depend on the problem**:This will be very large for some problems (e.g. certain deep architecture)
- 2nd-order methods can improve (or even eliminate) this dependency on kappa

### Derivation of Newton's method
- Approximate h(\theta) by its 2nd-order Taylor series around current \theta:

$$
h(\theta + d) h(\theta) + \nabla h(\theta) d + 
$$

- Minimize this local approximation to obtain
$$
d = -H(\theta) \nabla h(\theta)
$$

- Update current iterate with this
$$
\theta_{k+1} = \theta_{k} - H(\theta)^{-1}\nabla h(\theta_{k})
$$

**In practice people still use momentum for 2nd-order**

### Comparison to gradient descent
- Max allowable global learning rate for GD to avoid divergence:

- Gradient descent implicitly minimizes a bad approximation of 2nd-order Taylor series:

$$
h(\theta+d) \approx h(\theta) + \nabla h(\theta)^\top d + \frac{1}{2} d^\top H(\theta)d
$$

### Breakdown of local quadratic approximation

- Quadratic approximation of objective is only trustworthy in a local region around current $\theta$
- Gradient descent implictly approximates the curvature everywhere by its global max, and so doesn't have this problem
- Newton's method uses $H(\theta)$, which may become an underestimate in the region we are taking out update step

Solution: Constrain update d to lie in a trust region R around, where approximation remains good enough.
Subsitute Hessian with LI
The curvature is maximum every where

- LI is too pessimistic/conservative an approximation of the Hessian! It treats all directions as having max curvature.

### Trust regions and damping

**added to the hessian**

- $$\lambda$$ depends on r in a complicated way, but we can just work with directly
- Some methods allow you to adjust on the fly

### Alternative curvature matrices
**Hessian may not be the best matrix**

H(\theta) does not necessarily give the best quadratic approximation for optimization. Different replacements for could produce **a more global approximation** or **a more conservative approximation**.

- The most important family of related examples includes:
    - Generalized Gauss-Newton Matrix
    - Fisher Information Matrix
    - Empirical Fisher
- Nice properties versus normal Hessian:
    - always positive semi-definite, that is, no negative curvature
    - give parameterization invariant updates in small learning rate limit unlike Newton's method.
        - Newton's method invariant to linear reparametrization of the problem
    - work much better in practice for neural net optimization

### Barrier to application of 2nd-order methods for NN

- For neural networks, $\theta$ can have 10s of millions of dimensions

- We simply cannot compute and store an n*n matrix, let alone invert it.

- To use 2nd-order methods, we must simplify the curvature matrix's
    - computation
    - storage
    - and inversion

This is typically done by approximating the matrix with a simpler form.

### Diagonal approximations

**Very primitive approximation**
The simplest approximation: include only the diagonal entries of curvature matrix by setting the rest to 0

Properties:
- Inversion and storage cost O(n)
- Computational costs depends on form of original matrix that ranges from easy to hard
- Unlikely to be accurate, but can compensate for basic scaling differences between parameters

Used in RMS-prop and Adam methods to approximate Empirical Fisher matrix

### Block-diagonal approximation

Assuming b b bock size
Properties:
- Storage cost $$\mathcal{O}(bn)$$
- Inversion cost $$\mathcal{O}(b^2n)$$
- Similar difficulty to computing diagonal
- Can only be realistically applied for small block sizes

Well-known example developed for neural nets: TONGA

### Kronecker-product approximations
- Block-diagonal approximations of GGN/Fisher where blocks correspond to network layers
- Approximate each block as Kronecker product of two small matrices
- Storage and computation cost $$\mathcal{O}(n)$$
- Cost to apply inverse $$\mathcal{O}(b^0.5n)$$
- Used in current most powerful but heavyweight neural net optimizer K-FAC

## 5.Stochastic optimization

### Motivation
- Typical objectives in machine learning are an average of case-specific losses over training cases:
$$
h(\theta) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m h_i(\theta)
$$

- m can be very big, and so computing the gradient gets expensive:
$$
\nabla h(\theta) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \nabla h_i(\theta)
$$

### Mini-batching
- There is often significant statistical overlap between $$h_i(\theta)$$

- Early in learning, when "coarse" features are still being learned, most $$\nabla h_i(\theta)$$ will look similar

- Idea: randomly subsample a mini-batch of training cases of size b, and estimate gradient as
$$\nabla h(\theta) = \frac{1}{b} \sum \nabla h_i(\theta)$$

### SGD
- Stochastic GD replaces $$\nabla h(\theta)$$ with its mini-batch estimate 

- To ensure convergence,
    - Decay learning rate: $$\alpha_k = \frac{1}{k}$$
    - Use Polyak averaging
    - Slowly increase the mini-batch size during optimization

### Convergence of SGD
- Stochastic methods converge slower than correpsonding non-stochastic ones

**asymptotics are not the whole story**
- Iterations to converge
No log 

### Stochastic 2nd-order 
- Mini-batch gradients estimates can be used with 2nd-order and momentums methods too
- Curvature matrices estimated stochastically using decayed averaging over multiple steps
- No stochastic optimzation method that sees the same amount of data can have better asymptotic convergence speed than SGD with Polyak averaging
- Pre-asymptotic performance usually matters more in practice. So stochastic 2nd-order and momentum methods can be useful if
    - the loss surface curvature/condition nnumber is bad enough
    - the mini-batch size is large enough
