## Markov Processes

### Introduction to MDPs
- Markov decision process formally describe an environment for reinforcement learning
- Where the environment is fully observable
- i.e. The current state completely characterizes the process 
- Almost all RL problems can be formalized as MDPs
    - Optimal control primarily deals with continuous MDPs
    - Partially observable problems can be converted into MDPs
    - Bandits are MDPs with one state

### Markov Property
"The future is independent of the past given the present"
