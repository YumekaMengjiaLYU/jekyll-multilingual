「人是需要上发条的。」JH今天口吐金句。对，是发条精灵的发条。

发条让我们有行动力，让我们在寒冷的冬天推开绒被起床吃早餐。

发条让我们有从无生机的木偶变成魔幻音乐盒里的舞女。

重要的是，发条提醒我们，「时间滴答滴答就消逝了。」

「知道自己想要什么，是人生最重要的事。」

「我需要考虑的是，最不愿意失去的到底是什么。」

程浩，《站在两个世界的边缘》。

「真正牛逼的，不是那些可以随口拿来夸耀的事迹，而是那些在困境中依然保持微笑的凡人。」

「问问自己要什么？看看自己有什么？想想自己能放弃什么？」

「命运嘛，休论公道。不幸与幸运一样，都需要有人承担。」

「我们总是习惯借鉴别人的经验，效仿别人的成功，重走别人的老路。我们何时能够真正按照自己的意愿去活一次。不管是作为男人还是作为女人，热爱生活，热爱家庭，热爱事业，热爱梦想，更重要的是，热爱真实的自己，这就已经足够了。向谁学习都不如相信自己。也许是我太过天真，总是妄图用真实、善良、美丽的”血肉之躯“来冲击冰冷、黑暗、丑陋的”现实围墙“我当然明白自己的想法是多么苍白无力，但是我始终在坚持，始终在相信。不管这个世界有多么现实，你的心中都应该保留一份天真。」

「残缺也好，不完整也好，每个人都有自己难以启齿的一面。」

「也许，人们的坚持，往往不是因为相信未来，而是他们不想背叛过去。」

「只有脚踏实地的人，才能伸出双手拥抱星空。」

「朋友之间，只要彼此依靠就会很幸福。」

史铁生，《我与地坛》。

「十五年前的一个下午，我摇着轮椅进入园中，它为一个失魂落魄的人把一切都准备好了。那时，太阳循着亘古不变的路途正越来越大，也越红。在满园弥漫的沉静光芒中，一个人更容易看到时间，并看见自己的身影。」

「无言是对的。要是上帝把漂亮和弱智这两样东西都给了这个小姑娘，就只有无言和回家去是对的。」

《病隙碎笔1》
「所谓命运，就是说，这一出“人间戏剧”需要各种各样的角色，你只能是其中之一，不可以随意调换。」

「真正的信心前面，其实是一片空旷，除了希望什么也没有，想要也没有。」

「自卑，历来送给人间两样东西：爱的期盼，与怨愤的积累。」

「先哲有言：“人是一堆无用的热情。”」

FRANCES HODGSON BURNETT,  _A Little Princess_

「“Whatever comes," she said, "cannot alter one thing. If I am a princess in rags and tatters, I can be a princess inside. It would be easy to be a princess if I were dressed in cloth of gold, but it is a great deal more of a triumph to be one all the time when no one knows it.“」

「"I don't like it, papa," she said. "But then I dare say soldiers—even brave ones—don't really LIKE going into battle."」

「"It IS a story," said Sara. "EVERYTHING'S a story. You are a story—I am a story. Miss Minchin is a story."」

「"Sometimes I can and sometimes I can't," she said stoutly. "But when I CAN I'm all right. And what I believe is that we always could—if we practiced enough. I've been practicing a good deal lately, and it's beginning to be easier than it used to be. When things are horrible—just horrible—**I think as hard as ever I can of being a princess**. I say to myself, 'I am a princess, and I am a fairy one, and because I am a fairy nothing can hurt me or make me uncomfortable.' You don't know how it makes you forget"—with a laugh.」

Paulo Coelho, _The Alchemist_

「Intense, unexpected suffering passes more quickly than suffering that is apparently bearable; the latter goes on for years and, without our noticing, eats away at our soul, until, one day, we are no longer able to free ourselves from the bitterness and it stays with us for the rest of our lives.」

「The mere possibility of getting what we want fills the soul of the ordinary person with guilt. We look around at all those who have failed to get what they want and feel that we do not deserve to get what we want either. We forget about all the obstacles we overcame, all the suffering we endured, all the things we had to give up in order to get this far.」

「This is the most dangerous of the obstacles because it has a kind of saintly aura about it: renouncing joy and conquest. But if you believe yourself worthy of the thing you fought so hard to get, then you became an instrument of God, you help the Soul of the World, and you understand why you are here.」

「And he knew that shepherds, like seamen and like traveling salesmen, always found a town where there was someone who could make them forget the joys of carefree wandering.」

「The boy could see in his father's gaze a desire to be able, himself, to travel the world - a desire that was still alive, despite his father's having had to bury it, over dozens of years, under the burden of struggling for water to drink, food to eat, and the same place to sleep every night of his life.」

「It's the simple things in life that are the most ectraordinary」

「It's this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what's happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That's the world's greatest lie.」

「It's a force that appears to be negative, but actually shows you how to realize your Personal Legend. It prepares your spirit and your will, because there is one greatest truth on this planet: whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, it's because that desire originated in the soul of the universe. It's your mission on earth.」

「And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.」

你们在另外一个世界要元气啊，如果能做朋友该多好。
