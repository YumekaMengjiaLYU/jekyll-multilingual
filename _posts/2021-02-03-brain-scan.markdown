What Brain Scans Can Do
+ Show damage to brain tissue, the skull, or blood vessels in the brain

+ Be used with other medical tests to help doctors find the right diagnosis for mood and behavioral problems

+ Help researchers study healthy brain development, effects of mental illnesses or effects of mental health treatments on the brain

+ Making inferences on the presence of activity, to either a) test a theory, or b) characterize the pattern of brain responses to a task

+ Limiting the false positive rate to a specified level

+ Leverage hypothesis testing to provide evidence on a variety of theories: Is Area r involved in Task x?

Cannot

+ Diagnose mental illness when used by themselves

+ Predict risk of getting a mental illness


+ Reverse inference:
  + Does not provide direct inferences about psychological states
  + Need clever experimental designs, specialized analyses, meta-analyses

+ Establishing meaningful effects:
  + Terrible for estimating effect sizes and predictive accuracy

+ Testing assumptions
  + Inference depends on many assumptions
  + You must check these yourself

+ Comparing evidence for different theories
  + Just because a model shows some effect it does not mean it's the best model (or even close)

Benefits of co-registration
+ Allow one to visualize single-subject task activations overlaid on the individual's anatomical information

+ Simplify later transformation of the fMRI images to a standard coordinate system

Benefits of smoothing
+ May increase the validity of the statistical analysis
+ May overcome limitations in the normalization by blurring any residual anatomical differences

Benefits of normalization
+ Results can be generated to larger population 
+ Voxel-wise analysis is possible across individuals

Goals  of preprocessing
+ Minimimze the influence of data acquisition and physiological artifacts
+ Standardize the locations of brain regions across subjects to achieve validity and sensitivity in group analysis

+ Check statistical assumptions and transform the data to meet assumptions
