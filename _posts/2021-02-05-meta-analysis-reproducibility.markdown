Definition
The statistical analysis of a large collection of analysis results from individual studies for the purpose of integrating the findings

Why

+ Increase power and precision if studies are homogenous
  + Can detect effect as statistically significant with narrower CIs

+ Quantify effect sizes and their uncertainty if studies are homogenous
  + Reduce problems of interpretation due to sampling variation

+ Assess homogeneity/heterogeneity of results
  + Quantify among-study variation

+ Answer questions not posed by the individual studies
  + Factors that differ across studies
  + Comparative effectiveness of multiple interventions

+ Settle controversies arising from conflicting studies
  + Generate new hypothesis

+ ROI selection
+ Validate a new task or data acquisition approach
+ Functional decoding
+ Data-driven approach to validate cognitive models
+ Systematic analysis of variability (e.g., partipants, tasks, LABELS) can resolve conflict in a given community
