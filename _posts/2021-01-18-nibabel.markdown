NiBabel is a low-level Python library that gives access to a variety of imaging formats, with a particular focus on providing a common interface to the various volumetric formats produced by scanners and used in common neuroimaging toolkits.

NiBabel represents data as spatial images, a structure containing three things:
+ The image data array; a 3D or 4D array of image data

+ An affine matrix: 4 by 4 array relating voxel coordinates and world coordinates

+ Image metadata: usually a format-specific header
