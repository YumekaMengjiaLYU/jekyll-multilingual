our ikigai is the reason we get up in the morning

existential crisis is typical of modern societies in which people do what they are told to do, or what others do, rather than what they want to do. they often try to fill the gap between what is expected of them and what they want for themselves with economic power or physical pleasure, or by numbing their senses.

a donkey that is tied to a post by a rope will keep walking around the post in an attempt to free itself, only to become more immobilized and attached to the post. the same thing applies to people with obsessive thinking who become more trapped in their own suffering when they try to escape from their fears and discomfort.

1. What have I received from person X?

2. What have I given to person X?

3. What problems have I caused person X?

What makes us enjoy doing something so much that we forget about whatever worries we might have while we do it? When are we happiest? These questions can help us discover our ikigai.

Artists know how important it is to protect their space, control their environment, and be free of distractions if they want to flow with their ikigai.

The happiest people are not the ones who achieve the most. They are the ones who spend more time than others in a state of flow.


Flow is mysterious. It is like a muscle: the more you train it, the more you will flow, and the closer you will be to your ikigai.
