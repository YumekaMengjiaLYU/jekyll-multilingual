Logistic regression is the most basic algorithm for classfication. It extends the idea of linear regression to cases where the dependent variable only has a discrete number of outcomes, which are also called classes. Depending on the number of possible outcomes, we can classify logistic regression models into two types: binary logistic regression and multiple logistic regression. 


Instead of modeling `Y` as a linear function of `X` directly, we model the probability that is equal to class 1, given X. 

For this tutorial, we are going to use logistic regression to predict whether a patient has 10-year-risk of future coronary heart disease. The dataset can be downloaded [here][here].

We can import all the required libraries and our dataset:

{% highlight python %}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

grad_admissions = pd.readcsv('/Users/mengjialyu/Documents/Kaggle/graduate-admissions/Admission_Predict.csv')
{% endhighlight %}
Data preprocessing is an important initial step when doing machine learning projects. `seaborn` is a great library that can provide  a visualization of missing data. The `cmap` here refers to the mapping from data values to color space, abd 

{% highlight python %}
# Set the palette to the "pastel" default palette:
sns.set_palette("pastel")
sns.heatmap(heart_disease.isnull(), yticklabels = False, cbar= False)
{% endhighlight python %}
Now we have this pretty little graph :)

Let's fit the logistic regression model to our data:

{% highlight python %}

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(heart_disease, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

log_regressor = LogisticRegression()
log_regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = log_regressor.predict(X_test)

print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
{% endhighlight %}
