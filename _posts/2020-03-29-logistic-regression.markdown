Logistic regression is the most basic algorithm for classfication. It extends the idea of linear regression to cases where the dependent variable only has a discrete number of outcomes, which are also called classes. Depending on the number of possible outcomes, we can classify logistic regression models into two types: binary logistic regression and multiple logistic regression. 


Instead of modeling `Y` as a linear function of `X` directly, we model the probability that is equal to class 1, given X. 

For this tutorial, we are going to use logistic regression to predict whether a patient has 10-year-risk of future coronary heart disease. The dataset can be downloaded [here][here].

We can import all the required libraries and our dataset:

{% highlight python %}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import statsmodels.api as sm
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from statsmodels.tools import add_constant as add_constant

grad_admissions = pd.readcsv('/Users/mengjialyu/Documents/Kaggle/graduate-admissions/Admission_Predict.csv')

{% endhighlight %}
Data preprocessing is an important initial step when doing machine learning projects. `seaborn` is a great library that can provide  a visualization of missing data. The `cmap` here refers to the mapping from data values to color space, and `RdPu` is one color scheme option among many available. An alternative method is to simply display the sum of missings value in each data columnm.

{% highlight python %}

sns.heatmap(heart_disease.isnull(), yticklabels = False, cmap = 'RdPu')

# another way to check null values
heart_disease.isnull.sum()
{% endhighlight python %}
Now we have this pretty little graph :)

It looks like do not have much missing data. So we can exclude the rows with missing values.

{% highlight python %}
heart_disease.dropna(axis = 0, inplace = True)
{% endhighlight %}

Let's move on and fit a logistic regression model to our data.
First we need to filter out the features that really matters.

{% highlight python %}
heart_add_const = add_constant(heart_disease)
cols=heart_df.columns[:-1]

def back_feature_elem (data_frame,dep_var,col_list):
    while len(col_list)>0 :
        model=sm.Logit(dep_var,data_frame[col_list])
        result=model.fit(disp=0)
        largest_pvalue=round(result.pvalues,3).nlargest(1)
        if largest_pvalue[0]<(0.05):
            return result
            break
        else:
            col_list=col_list.drop(largest_pvalue.index)

result=back_feature_elem(heart_add_const,heart_disease.TenYearCHD,cols)
print(result.params)
{% endhighlight %}


> const        -9.129843
> male          0.561446
> age           0.065896
> cigsPerDay    0.019226
> totChol       0.002272
> sysBP         0.017534
> glucose       0.007280


The results show that `const`, `male`, `age`, `cigsPerDay`, `totChol`, `sysBP`, `glucose` are features that matter!
From the [data-description][here], we know that Sex-`male` is nominal variables. To apply a egression analysis on any dataset, normally we have to first tranform categorical features to dummy variables using the `get_dummies()` function from pandas. Dummy variables assign numerical values to the original categorical levels so that the computers can compute on them :) (More about [one-hot encoding][one-hot encode]) 

However for categorical variable with only two levels, there is no need to create dummy variables. As `sex` is binary in our dataset, we can leave it as it is.

{% highlight python %}

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

log_regressor = LogisticRegression()
log_regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = log_regressor.predict(X_test)


{% endhighlight %}

_how acccurate is our model?_

{% highlight python %}
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))


accuracy_score(y_test,y_pred)
{% endhighlight %}
The accuracy given is 85.5%. Good enough.
