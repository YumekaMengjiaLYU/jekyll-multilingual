[Note: The post is a summary of what I learning with the SQL for Data Science by Coursera]

Cross Join: each row from the first table joins with all the rows of another table

If the first table contains $x$ rows and the second table contains $y$ rows, you'll have the end result of $x$ multiplied by $y$

Syntax: FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2
